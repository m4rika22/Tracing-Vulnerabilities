  <h2>From Thesis to Tool &#x1F527;</h2>

  <p style="max-width: 800px">
    This simulator wasn't built in a day. Like I mentioned at the beginning, it
    started as my thesis project — titled
    <i>"Haavoittuvuuksien jäljillä"</i>, which means
    <i>"Tracing Vulnerabilities"</i> in English.
  </p>
  <p style="max-width: 800px">
    It started as a small idea — just a simulator and maybe a single HTML page
    with a few commands and theory. But somewhere between keeping it simple and
    doing justice to the theory I'd gathered, it grew. So yes, it became
    <em>a bit</em>
    more than I first imagined — and yes, built on more coffee-fueled sessions
    than I'd like to admit.
  </p>
  <p style="max-width: 800px">

    If you're curious about how this simulator was built — or want to dive into
    the theory of cybersecurity and ethical hacking (or learn Finnish the hard
    way) — check out the thesis on
    <a href="https://theseus.fi" target="_blank">Theseus.fi</a>. Just search for
    <b>Haavoittuvuuksien jäljillä</b>, written by Marika Salonen — hopefully
    available in spring 2025.

    If you'd like to reach out, you'll find me on LinkedIn — where I currently
    do absolutely nothing. That might change though, now that I finally have
    time for something other than this project — my beloved, exhausting little
    beast.
