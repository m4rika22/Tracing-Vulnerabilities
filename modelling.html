  3. Threat Modelling
</p>

<h3>Think Like an Attacker</h3>
<h1>Master Threat Modeling</h1>
<p>
  You've scanned the target. You've identified open ports, services, and OS
  details. Now comes the fun part: <b>thinking like the enemy.</b>
</p>
<p>
  This phase is called <b>threat modeling</b>. It's all about asking questions
  like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who might attack this system?</li>
  <li>What are they after?</li>
  <li>How would they get in?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  By stepping into the attacker's shoes, you can focus your efforts on the risks
  that matter most.
</p>

<h3>The Cyber Kill Chain: A Map of the Attack</h3>
<p>
  One beginner-friendly way to model threats is the <b>Cyber Kill Chain</b>,
  developed by Lockheed Martin. It breaks a cyberattack into 7 logical stages ‚Äî
  from initial recon to final impact.

<p>Here's a quick breakdown of what the Cyber Kill Chain includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Reconnaissance:</b> Gathering info (like you did with Nmap).</li>
  <li><b>Weaponization:</b> Crafting an exploit, malware, or phishing kit.</li>
  <li><b>Delivery:</b> Sending the payload via email, link, or website.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Exploitation:</b> Triggering the exploit ‚Äî for example, using a known
    vulnerability.
  </li>
  <li><b>Installation:</b> Installing malware for persistent access.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Command and Control (C2):</b> Gaining remote control of the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Actions on Objectives:</b> Stealing data, damaging systems, or causing
    disruption.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Why It Matters</h4>
<p>The kill chain helps defenders identify where to intervene. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can you detect early reconnaissance attempts?</li>
  <li>Can you block malicious payloads during delivery?</li>
  <li>Can you monitor and stop C2 traffic?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Even if you're just training,
  <b
    >thinking like a real attacker sharpens your skills as an ethical hacker.</b

</p>

<h3>Build Your First Threat Model</h3>
<p>
  Based on what you've discovered so far, you're ready to sketch a simple threat
  model for the target system.
</p>

<p>Let's review your earlier findings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open ports: SSH (22), HTTP (80)</li>
  <li>Web server: WordPress</li>
  <li>OS: Linux-based</li>
</ul>

<p>Now ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What would a real attacker try to achieve?</li>
  <li>Where are the likely weak spots?</li>
  <li>Which tools or exploits might work here?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Try to imagine how an attacker would move step-by-step through the kill chain
  toward their objective.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Target:</b> Linux server running Apache and WordPress, SSH enabled

    <li><b>Open Ports:</b> 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP)</li>

      <b>Potential Threats:</b>
      <ul>

        <li>Information disclosure via HTTP (e.g., <b>/wp-admin</b>)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Attacker's View:</b> High visibility, common entry points, easy recon

      <b>Possible Next Steps:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Run <b>wpscan</b> to check WordPress issues</li>
        <li>Use <b>nikto</b> to look for web server vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Attempt SSH login if credentials are weak or known</li>

      <b>Potential Attackers:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Amateur hackers looking for low-hanging fruit</li>

          Hacktivists targeting cultural institutions or public visibility
        </li>
        <li>
          Automated bots scanning for known WordPress or SSH vulnerabilities
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Attacker Motivation:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Changing the site's appearance as a form of protest or activism</li>
        <li>Using server as part of a botnet</li>
        <li>Stealing sensitive data (visitor info, login credentials)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>Don't Aim for Perfect ‚Äî Aim for Progress</h4>
<p>
  This is just a starting point. Your threat model doesn't need to be perfect ‚Äî
  what matters is that you're practicing a new way of thinking. You're
  connecting what you've scanned to how someone might exploit it. That mindset
  shift is what makes you dangerous ‚Äî in a good way.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, threat modeling is often one of the most time-consuming parts of
  penetration testing ‚Äî and right now, we're only scratching the surface.
