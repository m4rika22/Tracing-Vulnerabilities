  5. Exploitation
</p>

<h3>Time to Use What You Found</h3>
<h1>Exploitation — Breaking In</h1>

<p>
  You've done the recon. You've scanned for weaknesses. Now comes the exciting
  part: trying to actually use those weaknesses to gain access.
</p>

<p>
  This stage is called <b>Exploitation</b>. You use real tools and methods to
  test whether the vulnerabilities you found can be exploited — in other words,
  can you break into the system? Let's see how the attack might unfold!
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h2>Simulated Attack Path</h2>

<p>
  In this simulation, you'll be using a series of tools and techniques to
  exploit the vulnerabilities you found in the previous steps. Let's take a look
  at the some interesting stuff you found with nmap -sV --script vuln command. 
  I'm talking about THIS:
</p>
<img src="images/nmap_sv.png" alt="vulnerability_scan" />
<p>
   Under <b>http-enum</b> we have a bunch of interesting paths.See what happens when
  you connect them as an extension of the IP address!
</p>
<code>http://192.168.30.6/wp-login.php</code>
<p>And BOOM! Look what we have here:</p>
<img
  src="images/WP_login.png"
  alt="WordPress_login"
  style="width: 60%; height: auto"
/>
<p>
  This is great. We have a path to log in once we get the password. Now is your
  turn to keep digging. Check out the rest of the paths. You might find
  something interesting. Then, let's meet here. Take your time.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<img
  src="images/on-time_10931539.png"
  alt="Time"
  style="width: 100px; height: auto"
/>
<br />
<hr />
<br />

<p>Ok, are we ready? Great!</p> 
<p>We just explored login pages, potential brute-force 
  targets, version-revealing files, and other paths that might expose sensitive 
  or forgotten content.</p>

<p>
  "But what about that key?" you're probably wondering. And if not, let me tell
  you: it was in the images folder. Yeah, this one:
</p>
<img
  src="images/key_6100452.png"
  alt="Key_icon"
  style="width: 100px; height: auto"
/>

<p>
  What should we do with it? Let me tell you. Next, we'll save the image to our
  Kali Linux. So, make sure this is your current directory:
</p>

<code>http://192.168.30.6/images/key.png</code>
<p>
  <b
    >Mouse right-click → Save Image As... → Check the name of the image file →
    Save</b
  >
</p>

<p>
  The image was probably saved in your Downloads folder. Let's import it from
  there to the Kali Linux home directory:
</p>
<code>mv ~/Downloads/key.png /home/kali/</code>
<h3>Exploring Metadata</h3>
<p>
  Next, we will examine the metadata of the image. For this, we'll use a tool
  called <b>ExifTool</b>.
</p>

<p>This is how you can read the image metadata:</p>
<code>exiftool key.png</code>

<img src="images/key_metadata.png" alt="Metadata" />

<p>
  See anything interesting? Probably not. At least not on a comment line where
  there's <i>nothing to see</i>. &#x1F642; <br /> 
  ...Of course we have to peek at the path we just found! Open your browser and enter:
</p>
<code>http://192.168.30.6/hidden/nothing_to_see_here.html</code>
<p>
  Clearly, this takes simulation-based training to the next level. But what is this? We'll find out soon.
</p>
<img src="images/nothing_to_see.png" alt="Decrypting" />

<p><b>Chilling Reality Check: </b>When you upload an image online, the metadata 
  can spill sensitive info — like your exact location. A cyberstalker might not need to 
  do much digging to find your address. And if you're working somewhere confidential, well… 
  it might not stay that way for long. Creepy, right? Hackers can also abuse metadata as a 
  sneaky way to deliver malware. 
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />

<h3>Decrypting the Clues</h3>
<p>K, back to our findings.</p>
<p>
  "Just an old, forgotten file. Nothing important," it says. And then... some
  mysterious lines of code. Any idea what they are?
</p>
<p>
  In the world of white-hat hackers, information is rarely handed over on a silver platter.
  Messages tend to be hidden, disguised, or encrypted. To move forward,
  we'll need to <b>decrypt</b> this stuff.
</p>
<p>
  So, <b>nothing_to_see_here.html</b> file gave us three
  coded strings. Let's investigate them one at a time using free online tools.
</p>

<h4>Clue #1</h4>
<code>QmFuazoxMjM0NTY4Nw==</code>
<p>This looks like <b>Base64</b>-encoded text. To decode it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Go to
    <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/" target="_blank">base64decode.org</a>
  </li>
  <li>Paste the string into the input field</li>
  <li>Click <b>“DECODE”</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Did you get a result that points to bank codes? Great!</p>
<p>
  <b>Base64</b> is a method of converting binary data into readable
  text so it can be safely transmitted — like through email or web forms. Once
  received, the Base64 string can be decoded back into its original form. But
  here's the twist: Base64 is also a common way for attackers to hide malicious
  code. Since the commands aren't in plain text, security tools might miss them.
  So if something looks strange and unreadable — it could be Base64.
</p>
<h4>Clue #2</h4>
<code>Rznvy:vapbeerpg</code>
<p>This one's different. Try decoding it using <b>ROT13</b>:</p>
<p>
  Go to
  <a href="https://cryptii.com/pipes/rot13-decoder" target="_blank"
    >cryptii.com ROT13 decoder</a
  >
</p>
<p>We should now know the user's email password and that they are a funny person.</p>
<p>
  <b>ROT13</b> is a basic letter substitution cipher often used for
  learning the fundamentals of encryption. It replaces each letter with the one
  13 places down the alphabet.
</p>

<h4>Clue #3</h4>
<p>
  This one is a long list of 1s and 0s. You probably recognized that it's <b>binary
  code</b>. Every message written using symbols like letters or numbers can be
  represented as a string of binary digits — just 1s and 0s. This is how
  computers store and understand information. Well, now we should try to understand this:</p>
  <code>
    01010110 00110010 00111001 01111001 01011010 01000110 01000010 01111001
    01011010 01011000 01001110 01111010 01001111 01101101 01101100 01110011
    01100010 00110011 01011010 01101100 01011001 00110010 01000110 00110000
    01100011 01111010 01010101 00111101
  </code>
</p>

<p>To convert this binary into readable text:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Go to
    <a
      href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html"
      target="_blank"
      >RapidTables Binary to ASCII</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>Paste the entire binary string</li>
  <li>Click <b>“Convert”</b></li>
</ol>
<p>You'll see this result:</p>
<code>V29yZFByZXNzOmlsb3ZlY2F0czU=</code>

<p>Wait… That's another Base64 string! Let's decode it as well:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Go back to
    <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/" target="_blank">base64decode.org</a>
  </li>
  <li>Paste the code</li>
  <li>Click <b>“DECODE”</b></li>
</ol>

<p>&#x1F389; And you'll get the final result: <b>WordPress:ilovecats5</b>. We are going to use 
this one soon!</p>

<p>
  Please note that plaintext is encoded in many different languages and there
  are numerous decoding tools. Using the previous tools is not necessary, you
  may find much more suitable by googling. However, I would like to
  highlight one online tool in particular. &#x1F447;
</p>
<h4>The Magic of CyberChef</h4>
<p>I came across CyberChef during my cybersecurity studies, and I really liked 
  it — so now I want to share it with you too.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Here, check this:
    <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/" target="_blank"
      >gchq.github.io/CyberChef/.org</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>From Operations field, find "Magic".</li>
  <li>Drag and drop Magic to the Recipe field.</li>
  <li>
    Enter the binary code from the nothing_to_see_here.html file in the Input
    field.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now you can see the decoded string in the Output field. The Magic function
  recognized both binary and Base64 and gave a direct answer. Why didn't we use
  this right away? Maybe because we're here to learn. Maybe because I'm on a power trip.
  Both answers can be true at the same time.
</p>
<img src="images/CyberChef.png" alt="CyberChef" />
<br />
<p>
  If you look even more closely at the Magic feature's functionality, you'll
  notice that it allows you to enable Intensive mode and specify Depth. This
  tells us that sometimes finding the right decoding method can be a real
  challenge.
</p>
<p>
  The main point right now is, you can use this tool to decode many different
  formats. It's a great resource for anyone working in cybersecurity.
</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaway:</b> 
  Sometimes clues are hidden in layers. You might have to decode a string
  multiple times using different formats like <b>Base64</b>, <b>ROT13</b>, or
  even <b>binary</b> to get to the final answer. This is exactly the mindset of 
  a penetration tester: keep digging until the full picture becomes clear!
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Breaking In</h3>
<p>
  The third and final decoded password is one we can try out right away. You
  found the login page in WordPress while searching for subpages, now use it! 
  Open your browser and enter:</p>
<code>http://192.168.30.6/wp-login.php</code>
<p>Try username <b>Vivian</b> and password you just cracked.</p>

<img src="images/WP_Vivian.png" alt="WP_login" />

<p>Congrats, you cyber-sneaking legend — you got in! &#x1F389;&#x1F389;&#x1F389;</p>
<p>
  Now it's time for you to take a look around. Let's see where this takes us.
  Take all the time you need. Come back when you find something interesting. And
  come back even if you don't find anything. Then let's continue together!
</p>

<img
  src="images/on-time_10931539.png"
  alt="Time"
  style="width: 100px; height: auto"
/>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<p>If you checked the Media file, you maybe noticed this image:</p>
<img src="images/webadmin.png" alt="webadmin" />
<p>
  It looks like a web admin panel of a user named <b>webadmin</b>. Apparently Vivian
  has took a screenshot of it and added some text to description: <i>"J left this
  box open the last time he visited. Remember to ask him what this is."</i> And of all the 
  storage locations, she chose to save the image in the WordPress Media folder.
</p>
<p>Oh, this is bad. Except for us who are trying to access the server!</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Planning the Next Move</h3>

<p>
  So far, you've discovered username <b>webadmin</b>. But usernames alone
  aren't enough — we need passwords to gain access.
</p>

<p>Based on our earlier scans, we've learned that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The SSH port (<b>22</b>) is open — this means remote login attempts are
    technically possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    No multi-factor authentication or advanced protections were detected in our
    Nikto or Nmap scans.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These clues tell us that the system might be vulnerable to
  <b>brute force attacks</b> — where many password guesses are tried
  automatically. This is a common method used by attackers when credentials are
  not properly secured.
</p>

<p>
  Let's proceed and see if we can crack that <b>webadmin</b> password. If
  successful, we may gain SSH access — and that would open up a whole new layer
  of the system.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Using Metasploit for Brute Force</h3>

<p>
  <b>Metasploit</b> is a powerful and widely used framework for penetration
  testing. It contains tools for exploiting known vulnerabilities, scanning
  systems, and — as in our case — <b>brute-forcing login credentials</b>.
</p>

<p>
  In this simulation, we'll use Metasploit to try different password guesses for
  the <b>webadmin</b> user via SSH. If we find the right one, we gain system-level access.
</p>

<h4>Rocking with rockyou.txt?</h4>

<p>
  There is a well-known password list called <b>rockyou.txt</b>, which
  contains millions of real leaked passwords. You can find it in your Kali
  Linux, the location is <b>/usr/share/wordlists</b>. It will be available to you as
  soon as you unzip the compressed file. Rockyou.txt is used for brute-force
  attacks and you can try it too. But I warn you, it may take a long time to
  run. It can be hours. It can be days.
</p>

<p>
  No worries. Instead of using that huge password bank, we'll create a smaller custom list  
  with just 20 passwords — one of which is correct. We'll call it <b>popyou.txt</b> 
  (or whatever name you prefer).
</p>

<h4>Create Your Wordlist</h4>

<p>Open a terminal and run:</p>

<code>sudo nano /usr/share/wordlists/popyou.txt</code>

<p>Then copy and paste the following passwords into the file:</p>

<pre><code>
123456
password
letmein
welcome
trustno1
qwerty
abc123
iloveyou
admin
admin1
admin123
pass1234
toor
changeme
test123
webadmin
webadmin1
securepass
adminpass9
password9
</code></pre>

<p>
  Make sure to <b>save the file</b> for example with <b>CTRL + X</b>,
  <b>Y</b> and <b>Enter</b>.
</p>

<p>
  Now your custom wordlist is ready for use. Next, we'll configure Metasploit to
  try these passwords against the SSH service. Let's go!
</p>
<h3>Brute Forcing with Metasploit</h3>

<p>
  Now that we have a valid username (<b>webadmin</b>) and a custom
  wordlist (<b>popyou.txt</b>), it's time to launch a brute-force attack
  using Metasploit.
</p>

<h4>Step 1: Launch Metasploit</h4>
<p>Open a terminal in your Kali Linux and type the following command:</p>
<code>msfconsole</code>
<p>This starts the Metasploit Framework. It may take a few seconds to load, 
  it's norm-- OMG, I got a cow this time! &#x1F929;</p>
<img src="images/msf.png" alt="msfconsole" />

<h4>Step 2: Select the SSH Login Module</h4>
<p>Once Metasploit is up and running, type the following command to load the SSH
  login module:</p>
<code>use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login</code>
<p>
  This module is designed to test multiple SSH logins by trying different
  username and password combinations.
</p>
<p>Next, use this command:</p>
<code>show options</code>
<img src="images/msf_ssh_options.png" alt="show options" />
<p>Here you can see the available options for this module. We have to change some of 
  these settings.
</p>

<h4>Step 3: Set the Required Options for Attack</h4>
<p>Now configure the scanner with your target and your custom wordlist. 
  Enter all these commands in turn in the terminal:
</p>
<pre><code>
    set RHOSTS 192.168.30.6
    set USERNAME webadmin
    set PASS_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/popyou.txt
    set VERBOSE true
    </code></pre>
<p>Here's a brief summary of what we just did:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>RHOSTS</b> is the IP of the target machine.</li>
  <li><b>USERNAME</b> is the login name you're attacking.</li>
  <li><b>PASS_FILE</b> is your list of guessed passwords.</li>
  <li><b>VERBOSE</b> shows each login attempt on screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can check <b>show options</b> again to make sure all changes were
  saved.
</p>
<img src="images/Metasploit_show.png" alt="show_options" />

<h4>Step 4: Run the Attack</h4>
<p>
  Now that everything is set up, it's time to run the attack. Type the
  following command:</p>
<code>run</code>
<img src="images/verbose.png" alt="verbose" />
<p>
  See, Metasploit tries each password from your list. If one of them works,
  you'll see a message confirming... &#x1F447;
</p>

<h4>Step 5: Success!</h4>
<p>If all went as planned, you should see this result:</p>
<code> [+] 192.168.30.6:22 - Success: 'webadmin:adminpass9' </code>

<p>
  <b>Another breakthrough! Congratulations! More confetti! &#x1F389;&#x1F389;&#x1F389;</b><br /><br /> 
  You've just cracked your way into a real system! Well... into <em>a</em> system, at least.   This means 
  we now have shell access to the server via SSH.
  <p>Oh, and:</p>
  <code>exit -y</code>
  <p>assists you out of msfconsole.</p>
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h4>Accessing the Target via SSH</h4>
<p>
  Now that you've discovered the correct username and password, it's time to log
  in to the server. We'll use <b>ssh</b> (Secure Shell), a secure way to
  access remote machines from the terminal.
</p>

<p>Run the following command in your Kali terminal:</p>
<code>ssh webadmin@192.168.30.6</code>

<p>
  When prompted, enter the password you discovered using Metasploit.<br />
  If the credentials are correct, you should now be inside the target system —
  wohoo!
</p>
<img src="images/ssh_login.png" alt="ssh_login" />
<p>&#x1F50D; Once again, take your time — explore, experiment, enjoy.  
  And when you need it, your system-sidekick (me) will be waiting right there in the next step.
  </p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />

<h4>Exploring the System as webadmin</h4>
<p>
  You're in! Enough talk. Let's start simple.  
Just make sure you're back in the web admin's home directory — the same place you started from.  
Then run:
</p>
<code>ls -la</code>

<p>
  This will list all files in the current directory — even the hidden
  ones (those starting with a dot). Look carefully. Is there something odd?
  Something that looks... similar, but not quite?
</p>
<img src="images/ls_la.png" alt="ls -la" />
<p>This directory has an unusual name  —  try exploring it with:</p>
<code>cd .shh</code><br />
<p>For a change, take a peek inside with:</p>
<code>ll</code>
<img src="images/cd_ll.png" alt="ll" />
<p>
  Ok, there's another folder named <b>master_hint</b>. Sounds awesome for our mission! Use
  <b>cd-command</b> to open it:
</p>
<code>cd master_hint</code>
<p>
  Oh, permission denied? But if you noticed, there is also one file in the same
  location. Let's see what it has eaten. Open it using:
</p>
<code>cat .whisper</code>
<img src="images/whisper.png" alt="whisper file" />
<p>Trying to be all mysterious now, huh?</p>
<p>
  So, the question is: who has the Master Key? As a Linux user, you know the answer — even 
  if it's buried under the brain fog right now.</p> 
  
  <p>The <b>root</b> user, of course. And how do we become root? In this simulation, the 
    user <b>webadmin</b> has root privileges, so it's simple: we can switch to root using 
    the <b>sudo</b> command.
</p>
<code>sudo su</code>
<p>
  It worked, yay! U know, this is what super users do — they succeed. However, in real-world 
  systems, it's rarely this easy. The <b>sudo</b> command only works if your user account 
  has been granted root privileges — which often isn't the case.
</p>
<p>
  Gaining root access usually requires more work: exploiting a vulnerability,
  finding misconfigurations, or using privilege escalation techniques. But for
  now, consider yourself lucky. You already have the key.
</p>
<p>So let's use it.</p>
<p>
  Try accessing the <b>master_hint</b> folder again.
</p>

<code>cd master_hint</code>
<p>And now, let's see what's inside:</p>
<code>ls -la</code> 
<p>
  Great!  
  Now use the <b>cat</b> command to read the contents of the <b>.beyond</b> file inside.
  <img src="images/beyond.png" alt="beyond" />
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h4>Moving inside Linux system</h4>
<p>
  The previous file suggested that the information you're after is located under
  the root folder.
</p>
<p>
  Regular Linux users know this by instinct. Newbies — you're about to unlock another piece of the puzzle:
</p>
<img src="images/FolderStructure.png" alt="folder_structure" />
<p>And now when you are root user, you can move to right direction as easy as typing:</p>
<code>cd</code>
<p>OK, take a look around. We meet here again when you are ready!</p>
<br />

<h4>&#x1F387; Finding The Flag</h4>
<p>
  Often, penetration testing simulators revolve around capturing flags — small
  pieces of evidence proving that you've gained access or uncovered something
  important.</p> 
  <p>This simulator didn't use formal flags, but let's call this final
  discovery a flag — no: the Ultimate Flag! The only red flag in life worth 
  running toward. &#x1F6A9;</p>
  <p>&#x1F3C6;On this date <b>You</b> have just found a list of
  Da Vivian Code Gallery's customers, complete with contact details. This kind
  of data breach could seriously impact the company's future — or at the very
  least, cause major reputational damage.
</p>
<p>In case you are not following what I just said, try this when you are in 
  root's home folder:</p>
<code>cat finance/daviviancode_transactions</code>
<p>And now accept your trophy, because you have done a wonderful job: &#x1F3C6;</p>
<img src="images/transactions.png" alt="transactions" />
<p>
  Mission complete. The attack phase delivered — and there's more than enough to
  fill your report.
</p>

<br />
<hr />
<br />

<h3>BONUS: Visualizing the Attack Using MITRE ATT&CK</h3>
<p>
  You've done a great job and managed to hack both the website and the server.
  Let's take a look at how our attack progressed on the system using the
  <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">MITRE ATT&CK Framework</a>.
  This helps you connect your learning to how real-world threats are analyzed.
</p>
<p>
  The matrix you're looking at might seem a bit messy at first, but it's
  actually an awesome tool for making sense of how attacks work.</p> 
  <img src="images/ATT&CK_MITRE.png" alt="ATT&CK" />
  <h4>Step-by-step according to ATT&CK:</h4>
  <p>Look at the Enterprise matrix you just opened and try to spot the 
    <b>techniques</b> under the matching main categories called
  <b><u>tactics</u></b>. Soon the page will start to feel logical rather 
  than confusing.
</p>

<p>This is how you attacked the Da Vivian Code server:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    &#x1F50D; <b><u>Reconnaissance</u> — Active Scanning (T1595):</b>
    Used tools like WPScan, Nmap, and Nikto to gather service and version info.
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F511; <b><u>Initial Access</u> — Valid Accounts (T1078):</b> Found the username
    <b>vivian</b> and used it to log in to WordPress.
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F5A5; <b><u>Execution</u> — Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059.004):</b>
    Used terminal commands and ExifTool to analyze file contents and metadata.
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F4CC; <b><u>Persistence:</u></b>
    Not implemented in this simulation, but usually means creating a way to stay
    inside the system.
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F680; <b><u>Privilege Escalation</u> — Sudo and Sudo Caching (T1548.003):</b> Used
    <b>sudo</b> to switch from webadmin to root.

  <li>
    &#x1F575; <b><u>Defense Evasion:</u></b>
    You didn't try to hide anything, but the system you hacked had some tricks —
    like weird folder names and hidden paths — which are often used to confuse
    defenders and make important files harder to notice.
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F510; <b><u>Credential Access</u> — Brute Force (T1110.001):</b> Used Metasploit's
    <b>ssh_login</b> module to brute-force webadmin's password.
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F4C2; <b><u>Discovery</u> — File and Directory Discovery (T1083):</b> Explored the
    system using commands like <b>ls</b>, <b>cd</b>, and
    <b>cat</b>.
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F4E5; <b><u>Collection</u> — Data from Local System (T1005):</b>
    Collected internal hints and confidential customer data from the target
    system.
