<h2>Setting Up Your Hacking Lab</h2>
<h1>Build the Playground</h1>
<p>
  Before you dive into real attacks, you need a safe and controlled space to
  practice. This lab setup includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>VirtualBox</b> — to run virtual machines (VMs)</li>
  <li><b>Kali Linux</b> — VM 1: your attacker system</li>
  <li><b>DaVivianCode-Server</b> — VM 2: the vulnerable target</li>
  <li><b>NAT Network</b> — our way to connect the machines together</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>1. Install VirtualBox</h3>
<p>
  Time to get our virtual lab rolling! Download and install VirtualBox from the
  official site:
  <br />
  <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank"
    >https://www.virtualbox.org</a
  >
</p>
<p>
  Not sure how to install it? No worries! Google has your back. And as long as
  these links play along, here's one great option for Windows users:

</p>

<hr />

<h3>2. Get Kali Linux</h3>
<p>
  Now that VirtualBox is ready, it's time to bring in our hacking toolbox: Kali
  Linux.
</p>
<p>
  Head over to
  <a href="https://www.kali.org" target="_blank"> kali.org </a>
  and download the VirtualBox image.
</p>
<p>
  Need help with the setup? Google will gladly assist — or check out this
  helpful YouTube guide:

  </a>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Heads up: Sometimes, things don't go as smoothly as in the video. If Kali
  doesn't magically appear in VirtualBox after downloading, unzipping and
  clicking, don't panic. (Like I did when it first happened.) Just import it
  manually like we are also going to do in the next step:
</p>
<code>VirtualBox → File → Import Appliance -> Choose the right file</code>
<p>That's it! You're almost there.</p>
<hr />

<h3>3. Import the Target Machine</h3>
<p>
  Ok, let's bring in our target! We'll be importing a pre-configured vulnerable
  server that you'll be testing during the simulation.
</p>
<p>
  The server is called <b>DaVivianCode-Server</b>, and it's waiting for you to
  unleash your inner hacker. Download the virtual machine file (<b>.ova</b>)
  below and import it into VirtualBox.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0">
  <a
    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YfbJQIzXjzAbu6blX-L-tQuD2e1RP_gc/view?usp=sharing"
    target="_blank"
  >
    <button>Download Da Vivian Code Server (.ova)</button>
  </a>
</div>
<p>Once downloaded:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open VirtualBox</li>
  <li>Go to <b>File → Import Appliance</b></li>
  <img src="images/VB_Import.png" alt="Importing" />
  <li>Select the downloaded file</li>
  <li>Click <b>Finish</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Smooth, right? You just added your target machine to the lab. Just like that.
</p>
<p>Right now we are here:</p>
<img src="images/Virtualization.png" alt="Virtualization" width="50%" />
<p>
  On our host machine we're running VirtualBox—a Type-2 <b>hypervisor</b> and
  <b>virtualization</b> platform—which hosts <b>two VMs</b>: Kali Linux and the
  DaVivianCode-Server, which is very much an Ubuntu server.
</p>
<p>
  Problem: Currently Kali and DaVivian are like party guests on opposite sides
  of the room — time to connect the NAT network so they can mingle.
</p>
<hr />

<h3>4. Create a NAT Network</h3>
<p>
  Alright, time for a little VirtualBox magic. This step lets Kali and our
  target server finally talk to each other inside your lab.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open VirtualBox → Click <b>Tools</b> → <b>Network</b></li>
  <img src="images/VirtualBox_W.png" alt="VirtualBox" />
  <li>Enable Network Adapter</li>
  <li>Select <b>NAT Networks</b> → Click <b>+</b> to create a new one</li>
  <li>
    Give your network a nice name (Because why not? Mine is so lame. It's sad.)
  </li>
  <li>Set <b>IPv4</b> to something like: <b>192.168.30.0/24</b></li>
  <li>Make sure <b>DHCP</b> is enabled</li>
  <li>Click <b>Apply</b></li>
  <img src="images/VirtualBox_NAT.png" alt="VirtualBox_NAT" />
</ol>
<p>
  Nice! You've created your NAT network. But right now, your VMs are still like
  “uh... what's happening?” So let's plug them into the network. If your VMs are
  running, <b>power them off</b> first so we can adjust their settings safely.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <b>DaVivianCode-Server</b> in VirtualBox</li>
  <li>Go to <b>Settings</b></li>
  <li>Go to <b>Network</b></li>
  <li>Choose <b>NAT Networks</b></li>
  <li>Pick the NAT network you just created</li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  <img src="images/DaVivianNAT.png" alt="NetworkSettings" />
  <li>Repeat the same for your Kali Linux machine</li>
  <li>
    Then hit that green <b>Start</b> button on both VMs and bring them back to
    life
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Boom! Now both machines are on the same private network. They can chat with
  each other, but they're cut off from the outside world. Perfect for our safe
  and controlled hacking playground. Here's what your setup now looks like:
