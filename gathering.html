  2. Intelligence Gathering
</p>

<h3>Know Your Target</h3>
<h1>Collecting Valuable Intel</h1>

<p>Welcome to the point where real penetration testing begins!</p>
<p>
  According to PTES — and let's be honest, just plain logic — the first phase of
  any penetration test is information gathering, also known as reconnaissance.
  Before jumping into scanning ports or exploiting systems, it's crucial to
  understand the environment.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Step 1: Consider what we already know</h3>

<p>
  We have a virtualization platform, VirtualBox, on which we have installed Kali
  Linux and a target machine, DaVivianCode-Server. We want to perform a
  penetration test on the gallery's:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>website</li>
  <li>server</li>
</ul>
<p>
  That's pretty much all information we have at the moment. Let's change that!
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Step 2: What's my IP?</h3>
<p>
  Your first mission is simple: find out your Kali Linux machine's IP address.
  Use the following command in the terminal:
</p>
<code>ip a</code>
<p>If everything went as expected, you should see something like this:</p>
<img src="images/ip_a.png" alt="ip_a" />
<p>
  Look for the IP address next to the network interface <b>eth0</b>. This is the
  IP address of your Kali machine.
</p>
<p>
  Understanding who you are and where you stand in the network is always the
  first step in hacking — know yourself before you know the enemy. Well,
  technically speaking, Da Vivian Code Gallery is not our enemy, we act like the
  enemy online, but you get the idea.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Step 3: Find other hosts using Netdiscover</h3>
<p>
  Once you know your own address, you can search the network for other devices.
  Type this command into the terminal:
</p>
<code>sudo netdiscover </code>
<p>
  Netdiscover sends ARP requests to find active hosts. Soon after running the
  command, you should see a list of devices on the network:
</p>
<img src="images/netdiscover.png" alt="netdiscover" />
<p>
  <b>TIP: </b>At this stage, take the discovered IP addresses and test them in
  your Kali Linux browser!
</p>
<img src="images/browser.png" alt="browser" style="width: 60%; height: auto" />
<p>
  If a website opens, congratulations — you've just identified a web server, and
  it looks like your target. This is a simple but powerful trick: sometimes the
  easiest way to recognize a service is just to visit it. Now you know which IP
  runs the website you were asked to test. This will be important in the next
  steps of your simulation.
</p>
<p>
  No results? Make sure you are using http connection. If you just enter
  192.168.30.6 or your browser tries to use https:// automatically, the page
  might not load — even if the server is actually running. Here, have this:
</p>
<code>http://192.168.30.6</code>
<p>
  <b>NOTE: </b> Since IP addresses are assigned dynamically by DHCP, the target
  system may have a different IP address than the one shown in these examples.
  Be sure to replace the example IP (192.168.30.6) with the one you actually
  discover using Netdiscover.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Step 4: Passive Information Gathering — Using Public Sources</h3>
<p>
  Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is a goldmine for hackers. It's the art of
  collecting information from publicly available sources. It might sound basic,
  but it's incredibly powerful. You'd be surprised how much you can learn about:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Domain names</li>
  <li>Server types</li>
  <li>Email addresses</li>
  <li>Social media patterns</li>
  <li>Leaked data</li>
  <li>etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are plenty tools for OSINT research. Let us try this simple
  <b>whois</b> experiment. I'll spoil the surprise for you right away: by
  examining the IP address of the DaVivianCode-Server, we don't find much. So,
  let's do it for Google.
</p>
<code>whois google.com</code>
<p>
  After running the command, you should see a lot of information about the
  domain, including the registrar, the domain's expiration date, and the name
  servers.
</p>
<p>
  If you run <b>whois</b> on your target's private IP (192.168.30.6), you'll get
  a notice that it's part of a private range — meaning it's not traceable via
  public databases.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Step 5: Active Information Gathering — Meet the Almighty Nmap</h3>
<p>Nmap is your new best friend. It helps identify:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open ports</li>
  <li>Running services</li>
  <li>What Operating Systems (OS) the target might be using</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>BUT. </b>There's always a but. And when it comes to Nmap, it's a big one.
  Since I'm teaching this to you, I can't stress this enough:
</p>
<p style="color: red"><b>Never, ever Nmap without permission.</b></p>
<p>
  If you run a scan on, say, your bank's website
  <i>"just to see what's there,"</i> you might soon find yourself explaining
  your curiosity to the police. Seriously. Nmap is a great tool, but it's only
  meant for responsible use. It's also noisy. It won't go unnoticed, you'll get
  caught.
  <b>You have been warned.</b>
</p>
<p>
  Scared enough yet? Nah, don't worry. You have broad permission to scan and
  explore Da Vivian Code Gallery's server and website. And even if you overstep
  your privileges a little — say, by practicing something like installing a
  backdoor — nothing bad will happen. This is a training environment — a game.
  However, I recommend that you follow the script to learn the most important
  rule in real-life pen testing: <b>stick to the contract.</b>
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<p>
  OK, back to our mission! Now that you've found your target's IP address, it's
  time to actually learn something about the system. And that's where Nmap truly
  shines.
</p>

<p>
  Let's kick things off with a basic scan — no extra options, just the
  essentials:
</p>

<p>
  <b>Basic TCP scan:</b> This checks which ports on the target are open and
  listening.
</p>

<code>nmap 192.168.30.6</code>

<p>And there it is — our very first Nmap result! &#x1F389;</p>

<img src="images/Nmap_basic.png" alt="Nmap" />

<p>
  Not too scary, right? No overwhelming wall of text — just a clean,
  beginner-friendly output. It proves to you that I'm a kind simulator designer.
  Or maybe I just didn't have time to make it more complex.
</p>

<p>
  Even though the results are short, they already reveal a lot of useful
  information.
</p>

<h3>&#x1F9E0; What Can We Learn?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>The host is up:</b> The target responded to our scan — it's online and
    reachable.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Two open ports detected:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Port 22 (SSH)</b> — used for remote access via the command line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Port 80 (HTTP)</b> — indicates a web server is running (like a
        website).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Most other ports are closed:</b> Nmap reported that 998 TCP ports are
    closed. This means the system has a minimal attack surface — which is a good
    sign in terms of security.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>The system is virtualized:</b> The MAC address matches Oracle VirtualBox,
    suggesting the target is a virtual machine.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  &#x1F4A1; These are common services and can be great entry points for further
  exploration or analysis. Lesson to Learn: Just because the output is short
  doesn't mean it's useless. Sometimes fewer results just mean less noise — and
  that helps you focus.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>&#x1F50E; Comparing Nmap Scan Results</h3>

<p>
  Reading scan results can be tricky at first — but now that you've run your
  first basic Nmap scan, let's take it a step further. This time, we'll not only
  scan — we'll also save the results for later use.
</p>
<h4>Step 1: Choose The Scanners</h4>
<p>
  Let's pick two different types of Nmap scans to explore. Out of Nmap's many
  possibilities, we're going with <b>-sV</b> and <b>-O</b>. Why these two?
  Because they give us more detail — and also, because I said so. OK, let's take
  a closer look:
</p>
<p>
  <b>Version detection (nmap -sV)</b> tries to find out what service (and which
  version) is running on each open port. Let's run and save this scan.
</p>

<code>nmap -sV 192.168.30.6 > sv-scan.txt</code>

<p>You can view the saved results by reading the txt file you just created:</p>

<code>cat sv-scan.txt</code>

<p>&#x261D; Before we analyze anything, let's add one more scan to the mix.</p>
<p>
  <b>OS detection (nmap -O)</b> tries to identify what operating system the
  target is running:
</p>

<code>nmap -O 192.168.30.6 > o-scan.txt</code>

<p>Again, use <b>cat</b> to check the output.</p>
<p>
  Look at your results and think about how they differ from each other. Next, we
  will compare them together, using one very handy tool.
</p>

<h4>Step 2: Compare with diff</h4>
<p>
  While <b>diff</b> isn't usually thought of as a pentesting tool, it's actually
  super handy. We can use it to compare scan results and quickly see what's new
  or different. At this point we focus on what's different, with this simple
  command:
</p>

<code>diff sv-scan.txt o-scan.txt</code>

<p>
  The diff tool will highlight any differences between the scan results, helping
  you understand what each scan reveals.
</p>
<p>
  Easy, right? Probably not, when you're just starting out in this business. But
  that's okay — we'll walk through it together, with this image:
</p>
<img src="images/Diff1.png" alt="diff1" />
<br />
<p>
  <b>Key Takeaway:</b> Different Nmap options reveal different types of
  information. This comparison shows why it's important to choose the right scan
  depending on what you want to find out. <b>Diff</b> is a great tool for
  quickly spotting those differences. It's also useful for tracking changes over
  time — for example, if you run the same scan regularly and want to see what
  has changed.
</p>
<p>
  And now you also know how to save your scan results as files! This is super
  useful for later analysis or reporting.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h4>Nmap -A — The All-In-One Scan</h4>
<p>
  Now you know that it is possible to use Nmap for targeted results. But if you
  want, it is possible to get everything at once! There is a tool for that:
</p>
<p>
  This command is like asking Nmap to <i>"show me everything you've got."</i> It
  enables:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>OS detection</li>
  <li>Version detection</li>
  <li>Script scanning</li>
  <li>Traceroute</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we go:</p>
<code>sudo nmap -A 192.168.30.6</code>
<p>
  After running the command, you should see a lot of information about the
  target system. While <b>your results may differ slightly</b>, you might
  already notice some familiar elements from previous scans. I've highlighted a
  few details in this image that are worth paying attention to:
</p>
<img src="images/nmapA.png" alt="nmap_a" />
<p>
  Great job! We already know much more about our target than when we started.
  Finally, let's summarize what we learned so far.
