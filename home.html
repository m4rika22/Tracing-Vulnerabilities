    Hey there, white-hat-to-be! You've just stepped into a beginner-friendly
    introduction to <b>penetration testing</b> — and this is your safe space to
    learn the basics of ethical hacking.
  </p>

  <br />
  <p style="max-width: 700px">
    I've put together a complete hands-on simulation for you to explore. You'll
    be testing the security of a custom-built target machine inside
    <b>VirtualBox</b>, using a <b>Kali Linux</b>
    attacker machine. If you're not familiar with Linux yet — no worries, but I
    highly recommend brushing up on the basics. Knowing how to navigate the file
    system, use terminal commands, and understand user privileges will make your
    journey much smoother.
  </p>

  <p style="max-width: 700px">
    This simulation is actually my thesis project as a student of Business
    Information Technology. I'm offering it to you as a gift — from one
    cybersecurity beginner to another.<br />

    Sure, this environment is designed for beginners, but that still doesn't
    mean it's lightweight. Brace yourself — your brain's about to meet a wave of
    new tools, tactics, and terms. It's probably going to take some time for
    everything to fall into place — but I've learned this, and so will you.
