  About PTES
</p>

<h3>Hackers Use Maps Too</h3>
<h1>What is PTES?</h1>

<p>
  PTES stands for <b>Penetration Testing Execution Standard</b>. It's a
  framework that helps security professionals run structured, professional, and
  repeatable penetration tests. Like a checklist with purpose — telling you what
  comes next.
</p>

<p>
  The PTES process is divided into <b>seven logical phases</b> — and this
  simulation follows each of them.
</p>

<h3>The 7 Phases of PTES</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Pre-Engagement:</b> You define the rules with the client — what's
    allowed, what's off-limits, and what you're testing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Intelligence Gathering:</b> You collect as much information as possible
    about the target — like a hacker preparing their plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Threat Modelling:</b> You analyze the information and imagine how an
    attacker might break in. What are the weakest links?
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Vulnerability Analysis:</b> You use tools to find real weaknesses —
    missing updates, exposed logins, weak passwords, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Exploitation:</b> Time to act. You try to break in using the
    vulnerabilities you've found.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Post-Exploitation:</b> Once inside, you evaluate what you can access and
    how far the breach could go.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Reporting:</b> You document everything in a clear report, helping the
    client fix the problems.
  </li>
</ol>

  Looks pretty much our sidenav, right? In this simulation, you'll work your way
  through each phase — combining hands-on tasks with key theory — to understand
  how real-world ethical hacking is done.
