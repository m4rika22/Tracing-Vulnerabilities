  6. Post-Exploitation
</p>

<h3>You've Got Access. Now What?</h3>
<h1>Post-Exploitation</h1>

<p>
  You probably noticed once you've broken into the system, the real fun begins —
  and so does the responsibility. It's the phase, you explore what you've gained
  access to and evaluate how valuable it is.
</p>

<p>This step is called <b>Post-Exploitation</b>. The goals usually are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#x1F9E0; Understand the value of the compromised system</li>
  <li>&#x1F575; Explore if more systems can be accessed from here</li>
  <li>&#x1F4CC; Set up persistent access</li>
</ul>

<h4>What Can a Hacker Actually Do at This Point?</h4>
<p>
  Once inside, an attacker could do much more than just peek around. Here are a
  few examples of what could happen post-exploitation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#x1F6C3; Steal passwords and session tokens</li>
  <li>
    &#x1F4C2; Dump sensitive files, such as customer records or internal
    documents
  </li>
  <li>&#x1F41B; Install malware or backdoors for future access</li>
  <li>&#x21AA; Jump to other connected machines</li>
  <li>&#x1F9F9; Delete logs to cover tracks</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data, Access, and Value</h4>
<p>After gaining access, an ethical hacker will explore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What sensitive data is available?</li>
  <li>Can the access be used to move laterally (to other systems)?</li>
  <li>What risks does this access pose to the organization?</li>
</ul>

<h4>How Valuable Is This System?</h4>
<p>
  A penetration tester must assess how important the compromised system is. Ask
  yourself:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it a regular user workstation or a central server?</li>
  <li>Does it store or connect to confidential data?</li>
  <li>Could it be used to impersonate someone important?</li>
</ul>

<h4>&#x1F6D1; What We Didn't Do (But Real Hackers Might)</h4>
<p>
  In this simulation, we didn't actually install a persistent backdoor. But in
  the real world, attackers often leave behind ways to return later, even after
  the system is rebooted.
</p>
<p>These methods could include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#x1F573; Adding a hidden user with admin rights</li>
  <li>&#x23F0; Modifying scheduled tasks (cron jobs)</li>
  <li>&#x2699; Creating malicious services or scripts that auto-launch</li>
</ul>

<h4>Persistence: Staying in the System</h4>
<p>
  In a real-world attack, an intruder would want to come back later — silently.
  This is done by setting up something called a <b>reverse shell</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Why reverse? Because instead of the attacker connecting in (which would be
  blocked by firewalls), the <b>target system connects out</b> to the attacker's
  machine. This looks like normal traffic — like checking for software updates
  or browsing the web.
</p>

<p>
  Once that connection is open, the attacker can control the system remotely.
  This is known as "phoning home." In real-world scenarios, attackers might even
  route their traffic through countries like China or North Korea to confuse
  investigations.
</p>
<hr />

<h3>Important Note</h3>
<p>
  In real penetration tests,
  <b>post-exploitation is where ethical boundaries matter most</b>. You only go
  as far as the contract allows.
</p>
<p>
  &#x1F4DC; In our simulation agreement, actions like planting backdoors or
  creating persistent access were marked as out of scope.
</p>
<p>
  That said — this is a safe sandbox. So if you'd like to experiment with how
  backdoors work for learning purposes, you're totally welcome to. Just
  remember: in real life, these steps require strict permission — or you're
  crossing a legal line.

  <h4>Recap: What Post-Exploitation Covers</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You've gained access to the system</li>
    <li>You checked what data was available</li>
    <li>You evaluated how powerful the access was</li>
    <li>You learned what attackers might do to maintain access</li>
  </ul>
