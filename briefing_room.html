<h3>Briefing Room</h3>
<h1>Mission Overview</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the Briefing Room!&#x1F575; <br />
  <br />
  You've been brought in by a small but rising art gallery called
  <b>Da Vivian Code</b>. Their online presence is growing fast — and so is the
  number of people visiting their website.
</p>
<p>
  But here's the catch:<br />
  The site was originally built by someone who wasn't a professional, and now
  the gallery owner is getting worried. Could there be security holes hidden
  under the surface?
</p>
<p>
  Your mission:<br />
  Put on your ethical hacker hat and test the security of their server and
  website. You're going to simulate an attack, just like a real hacker would —
  but with one big difference:<br />
  You're here to help, not to harm. <b>You are a penetration tester now!</b>
</p>
<br />
<p style="text-align: center; color: #666; font-style: italic">
  Find the weak spots.<br />
  Understand how attackers think.<br />
  And most of all — help Da Vivian Code protect their art from the shadows of
  the internet.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<p>
  This simulation follows the
  <strong>PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)</strong> — an
  internationally recognized framework for professional penetration tests.
  Before you begin, let's take a quick look at what PTES actually includes — and
  how it will guide your journey through the Da Vivian Code infrastructure.
