  4. Vulnerability Analysis
</p>

<h3>Looking for Weak Spots</h3>
<h1>Vulnerability Analysis</h1>

<p>
  In this phase, you go hunting for weaknesses. Not just guessing ‚Äî now you use
  actual tools to identify flaws in the system that could be exploited by an
  attacker.
</p>
<h3>Some important theory</h3>
<p>
  There are many good tools for vulnerability scanning. Before we get into a few
  of them, let's get familiar with some important terms when it comes to
  vulnerability analysis.
</p>

<p>Vulnerabilities can appear in many forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    &#x1F4BB;<b> Software vulnerabilities:</b> like XSS and SQL injection.
  </li>
  <li>
    &#x2699;&#xFE0F;<b>Configuration flaws:</b> weak passwords, missing encryption, excessive
    permissions.
  </li>
  <li>&#x1F50C;<b>Hardware flaws:</b> physical-level issues (rare, but real).</li>
  <li>
    &#x1F9E0;
<b>Social vulnerabilities:</b> human errors or tricks (phishing, bad
    practices).
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>CVE ‚Äî The Vulnerability Encyclopedia</h4>

<p>
  CVEs (<b>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</b>) are unique IDs for known security
  flaws. On this path, you will come across these things often. In real-world testing, 
  spotting a known CVE can feel like finding a name tag on your bug. It means others have 
  seen it, rated it, maybe even written an exploit for it ‚Äî and now, you're part of that 
  story too. This is how CVE entries look like:</p>
</p>
<img src="images/CVE.png" alt="CVE" />

<p>You see, the year is 2033 ‚Äî so clearly, we're going back to the future. What 
  secrets does this timeline hold? Could this be the very vulnerability YOU have 
  uncovered? That moment when nerds ask, ‚ÄúDo you have a CVE?‚Äù ‚Äî and you casually 
  say, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

<h4>CVSS ‚Äî Common Vulnerability Scoring System</h4>
<p>How critical is your CVE discovery? We don't know it yet, but that's where 
  CVSS scoring comes in. CVSS gives each vulnerability a number from 0 to 10, 
  based on how much trouble it could cause. The higher the score, the scarier 
  the bug. Think of it as the danger meter for your findings.</p>
  <img src="images/CVSS.png" alt="CVSS" />
  <p>Okay, let's say your CVE discovery scores a lucky number <b>7.7</b>. What does 
    that mean? It means you've just hit a high-risk vulnerability. Congratulations! 
    And thoughts and prayers for the system where you found the vulnerability.</p>

<h3>What About OWASP?</h3>
<p>
  So you're finding vulnerabilities, assigning them CVE numbers, and scoring their 
  danger level with CVSS. But how do you know what types of issues are most common
   ‚Äî and most dangerous ‚Äî in real-world web apps? That's where OWASP Top 10 comes 
   in.</p>
  <p>OWASP (<b>Open Web Application Security Project</b>) is a non-profit project that keeps 
    track of the nastiest web application vulnerabilities. Their Top 10 list is basically 
    a cheat sheet of the bugs attackers love and defenders fear.
</p>
<p>I recommend you to take a closer look: <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  OWASP Top 10
</a></p>


<h3>Always Be Careful with Scan Results</h3>
<p>
  Not all vulnerabilities found are exploitable. And most importantly, not all
  exploitable vulnerabilities are found by scanners. We are talking about 
  these results:
</p>

<p>
  &#x1F941; <b>False Positive: </b>Scanner reports a vulnerability that isn't really
  there. Wastes time, but doesn't put the system at risk.
</p>
<p>
  &#x1F648;&#x2757; <b>False Negative: </b>Scanner fails to detect a real vulnerability.
  <b>Serious risk</b> ‚Äî attacker may find it before you do.
</p>
<p>
  Scanning is great ‚Äî but not enough. Penetration testing is essential.
</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h2>Start Scanning!</h2>
<p>
  Now it's time to get hands-on. Run the following scans on your target server
  and take notes on what you find. I'll guide with the results and we will put
  some of the theory we just covered into practice.
</p>

<h4>WPScan (for WordPress):</h4>
<p>
  WPScan is a specialized scanner for WordPress. It checks for known
  vulnerabilities, outdated plugins, and weak passwords. It's definitely a 
  tool worth trying when targeting WordPress. Here, try this command in your 
  Kali Linux terminal:</p>

<code>wpscan --url http://192.168.30.6 --enumerate vp</code>
<p>
  Okay, let's see what we have. Your results may not be identical, but these 
  are the kinds of findings you can expect:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Server: Apache/2.4.58 (Ubuntu)</b><br />
    This tells us what web server is running. Knowing the version can help
    identify possible vulnerabilities.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>XML-RPC enabled</b><br />
    This WordPress feature allows remote commands. 
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>readme.html found</b><br />
    Confirms that the site is running WordPress and may leak the version number
    to attackers.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>wp-cron.php active</b><br />
    This is WordPress's background task manager. If not secured, it can be 
    exploited to overload the server or slow down the site.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Theme: Twenty Twenty-Four (v1.3)</b><br />
    Identifies the active theme. Outdated or poorly coded themes can contain
    vulnerabilities.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Directory listing is enabled</b><br />
    This allows anyone to view the file structure of a folder, which may expose
    sensitive files.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>No WPScan API Token provided</b><br />
    That's on you ‚Äî the key wasn't given. Without it, the scanner can't fetch 
    detailed vulnerability data, including CVEs when available.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Getting an API key for WPScan is simple and something you might want to try later. 
  But we'll skip it now to save time. What matters here is this: there's a dedicated 
  scanner just for WordPress. I recommend you to explore its possibilities. And I'm 
  also going to introduce one more specific scan, which will be very exciting 
  for us in the next step.
</p>
<p><b>To find possible WordPress usernames, use the command:</b></p>
<code>wpscan --url http://192.168.30.6 --enumerate u</code>
<p>
  As you scroll through the results, you should come across a less surprising
  discovery: the username <b>Vivian</b>. Take a note of this ‚Äî it might help 
  you during login attempts.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>üîç Tip:</b> You can manually check if a service or version is known 
  to be vulnerable.</p>

<p>For example, we've found:</p>

<code>Apache 2.4.58</code>

<p>
  Want to know more? </p>
  <ol><li>Head over to the 
  <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" target="_blank">NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</a>.</li> 
  <li>Use the <b>CPE Search</b> feature to look up <em>Apache 2.4.58</em>
  <img src="images/NIST_CPE.png" alt="NIST_CPE" /></li>
  <li>Choose <b>View CVEs</b></li>
   <li>See a list of related <b>CVEs</b> (vulnerability entries) with their <b>CVSS scores</b>:
    <img src="images/NIST_CVEs.png" alt="NIST_CV" /></li>
</ol>

<p>
  This kind of manual lookup is especially useful when:
  <ul>
    <li>You're not using automation tools</li>
    <li>You want to double-check what a scan found</li>
    <li>You're curious how real vulnerabilities are documented and scored</li>
  </ul>
</p>    

<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Let's Dig Deeper with Nmap!</h3>
<p>
  We've already looked at some basic scans, but now it's time to <b>dig 
    into vulnerabilities</b>. This time, we'll use Nmap's powerful scripting 
    engine to check if the target has any known weak spots.
</p>

<code>sudo nmap -sV --script vuln 192.168.30.6</code>

<p>
  This command doesn't just list open ports ‚Äî it also <b>checks if those 
    services are known to be vulnerable</b>. It's like asking: ‚ÄúHey, has 
    this software ever had a security issue?‚Äù üïµÔ∏è
</p>

<h4>&#x1F9E0; What Did We Find?</h4>
<p>At first glance, this scan might look like a wall of text. The good news is: 
  we only need to pick out a few important signals from the noise. Many of the 
  elements you've seen in earlier scans appear here as well. Here's a summary 
  of the interesting things that probably popped up:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      &#x2705; <b>Open Ports</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Port <b>22 (SSH)</b> and <b>80 (HTTP)</b> are open.</li>
        <li>These are like open doors ‚Äî they allow remote login (SSH) and web traffic (HTTP).</li>
        <li>That also makes them <b>potential entry points</b> for attackers.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      &#x26A0;&#xFE0F; <b>Vulnerabilities Detected</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The <b>SSH service</b> has several <b>critical vulnerabilities</b> 
          ‚Äî some rated <b>10/10</b> on the severity scale! That's <b>CVSS</b> 
          in action.</li>
        <li>The <b>web server</b> (Apache 2.4.58) also has multiple <b>high-risk 
          issues</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      &#x1F4A5; <b>Exploits Exist</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Many of these vulnerabilities have <b>public exploits</b> ‚Äî ready-made attack 
          code available online.</li>
        <li>This means the system could be <b>easy to attack</b>, especially if it's unpatched.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      &#x1F310; <b>WordPress Revealed</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The site is running <b>WordPress</b>, and we found a username: 
          <b>‚Äúvivian‚Äù</b>.</li>
        <li>There's a possible <b>CSRF vulnerability</b> (sneaky commands accepted without 
          user permission).</li>
        <li>An <b>internal IP address</b> (<b>127.0.1.1</b>) was leaked ‚Äî sign of 
          <b>misconfiguration</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      &#x1F4C2; <b>Bonus: Interesting Files and Folders</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>/wp-login.php</b> ‚Äî Admin login page</li>
        <li><b>/readme.html</b> ‚Äî Confirms WordPress is used</li>
        <li><b>/images/</b> ‚Äî Directory listing enabled</li>
        <li>Also: traces of <b>very old WordPress files</b> 
          (like versions 2.2 to 2.7). Even if they're not active, they might still 
          be exploitable.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>&#x2705; <b>In Summary</b></p>
<p>
  This scan didn't open any doors for us ‚Äî <b>yet</b>. But it showed us:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A valid <b>login username</b></li>
  <li>Signs of <b>misconfigured settings</b></li>
  <li>Several <b>known vulnerabilities</b>, with real exploits available</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We've seen <b>cracks in the wall</b>, and that's exactly what we need for the next step.
  Let's keep going. &#x1F50D;
</p>

<br />
<hr />
<br />
<h3>And then there is Nikto</h3>
<p>
  Now that we've scanned for open ports and known vulnerabilities, let's try something new: 
  <b>Nikto</b> is a web server scanner ‚Äî it checks websites for 
  <b>common issues and misconfigurations</b>.
</p>

<code>nikto -h http://192.168.30.6</code>

<p>Let's take a look at what it found.</p>

<h4>&#x1F9E0; What Did We Learn from Nikto?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    &#x2699;&#xFE0F; <b>Missing Security Headers</b>
    <ul>
      <li>No <b>X-Frame-Options</b></li>
      <li>No <b>X-Content-Type-Options</b></li>
      <li>These small headers help browsers protect users from basic web-based attacks.</li>
    </ul>    
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F6E0;&#xFE0F; <b>Web Server Behavior</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Server returns a valid response with junk HTTP methods. This may cause false positives.</li>
      <li><b>/images/</b> has <b>directory listing enabled</b></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F5C2;&#xFE0F; <b>Interesting Files and Paths like:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>/wp-links-opml.php</b></li>
      <li><b>/license.txt</b> may reveal software details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    &#x1F310; <b>WordPress Confirmed Again</b>
    <ul>
      <li>WordPress detected</li>
      <li>Login page found: <b>/wp-login.php</b></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>&#x2705; In Summary</h4>
<p>
  Nikto didn't find anything catastrophic, but it showed us several 
  <b>common misconfigurations</b> worth cleaning up:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Missing security headers</li>
  <li>Files leaking system info</li>
  <li>Open folders</li>
  <li>More WordPress exposure</li>
</ul>
<p>
  All in all, it's a helpful second opinion ‚Äî and every piece adds to our full picture of the target.

  <h3>Bonus: Nessus Vulnerability Scanner &#x1F916;</h3>

  <p>
    While there are many scanners out there, Nessus stands out for its easy-to-use interface and clear results. 
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Important:</b> Nessus is not pre-installed on Kali Linux, so you'll need to install and set it up first. 
    Based on experience, this process can take a bit of time.</p>
  
  <h4>Installation Steps:</h4>
  <p>Here's a good Nessus installation guide for Kali Linux:</p>
    <p><a href="https://mwaseemaw.medium.com/nessus-installation-in-kali-linux-2f0cbae39b64" target="_blank">Nessus 
        Installation in Kali Linux by  Mohammed Waseem</a></p>
    <p>If you decide to try this scanner yourself, be patient. Once the scanner is available, 
      it's really easy to use. Just:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose <b>New Scan</b> ‚Üí <b>Basic Network Scan</b></li>
    <li>Enter your target IP (<b>192.168.30.6</b>)</li>
    <li>Start the scan and wait for the results</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Nessus will list vulnerabilities by severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical), and each finding links to 
    a CVE with more info. It also suggests how to fix them ‚Äî great for learning!
  </p>
  <p>
    Nessus uses the <b>CVSS scoring system</b> automatically to rate the severity of each vulnerability it finds. 
    You'll see scores from <b>0 to 10</b>, color-coded by risk level. This makes it easier to prioritize the most 
    dangerous vulnerabilities.
  </p>
  <p>This is what the Basic Scan results currently look like:</p>
  <br />
  <img src="images/Nessus.png" alt="Nessus scan" />
  <br />
  <p>Looks nice, right? Enjoy the peaceful colors while you can ‚Äî scan something like 
    Metasploitable in the future and watch this pie chart turn into a full-blown cyber 
    crime scene.</p>
    <p>Over time, our target machine itself might become more vulnerable, because software ages. 
      That's actually part of the lesson: systems need updates to stay secure.</p>
  <p>Don't be fooled by short lists. One entry might hide several vulnerabilities under the 
    hood ‚Äî like in our Apache case here:</p>
    <br />
    <img src="images/Nessus2.png" alt="Nessus_Apache" />
    <br />
  <p>Nessus reports things clearly and even offers suggested fixes ‚Äî pretty great, right? 
    But don't let the clean layout fool you. Like all automated scanners, Nessus isn't perfect. 
    False positives and false negatives are a real thing. While writing my thesis, I came 
    across a study showing that Nessus missed up to 69% of tested vulnerabilities. Always review 
    the results carefully and verify important findings manually.
  </p>
