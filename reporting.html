<h3>You Know It — Report It!</h3>
<h1>Reporting Your Findings</h1>
<p>
  &#x1F4DC; Now it's time to turn your findings into a clear report. Some of the
  issues uncovered in this simulation would require professional expertise to
  fully fix, but it is still important to keep the report as easy to read as
  possible.

  <h2>Penetration Testing Report Summary</h2>
  <div class="contract-content">
    <b>TESTER:</b>
    <p>You — ethical hacker extraordinaire.</p>

    <b>CLIENT:</b>
    <p>Da Vivian Code, represented by Vivian C.</p>

    <b>OBJECTIVE:</b>
    <p>
      Identify security vulnerabilities in Da Vivian Code's website and server
      infrastructure through simulated attacks and document the findings.
    </p>

    <b>KEY FINDINGS:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Discovered valid WordPress user: <b>Vivian</b></li>
      <li>The scan revealed misconfigured folders</li>
      <li>Discovered a file with easily decoded passwords</li>
      <li>
        Image containing sensitive information in WordPress's Media folder
      </li>
      <li>
        Brute-forced webadmin SSH login using <b>Metasploit</b> and a custom
        wordlist
      </li>
      <li>Gained root access and retrieved sensitive customer data</li>
    </ul>

    <b>VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Exposed login portals (e.g., <b>/wp-login.php</b>)</li>
      <li>Misconfigured file permissions and directory listing enabled</li>
      <li>Weak SSH password (discovered via brute force)</li>
    </ul>

    <b>RISK IMPACT:</b>
    <p>
      Compromise of administrative accounts and access to confidential customer
      records. Potential for major reputational damage if exploited by a real
      attacker.
    </p>

    <b>RECOMMENDATIONS:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Implement strong password policies and two-factor authentication:</b>
        Prevent brute-force attacks even if credentials are guessed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Deploy Fail2Ban or similar protection:</b> Automatically detect and
        block repeated login attempts over SSH or WordPress.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Remove outdated or sensitive files from public directories:</b>
        Files like <b>readme.html</b> can leak information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Disable unnecessary services:</b>
        Minimizes attack surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Limit SSH access:</b> Restrict by IP if possible, or move to
        non-default ports.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Conduct regular vulnerability scans and patch outdated services:</b>
        Especially web servers, WordPress core, themes, and plugins.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <b>OVERALL SEVERITY:</b>
    <p>
      <b style="color: darkred">HIGH</b> — Immediate security improvements are
      recommended

    <b>Note:</b> This summary gives you a basic idea of how a report might look
    after a penetration test. In real-world engagements, professional reports
    are often several pages long and include detailed technical data, attack
    paths, timelines, screenshots, and mitigation steps.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are not just a checklist — they are documents that help organizations
    improve their security posture.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Pro Tip:</b> The recommendations in your report are often called
    <b>hardenings</b>. You can find excellent hardening guides by searching
    online for terms like "Linux hardening checklist", "WordPress hardening",
    "Ubuntu fail2ban" etc. Try applying some of them and then run your scanners
    again — it's a great way to see the difference! You also found files and
    folders that are better off deleted completely.
  </p>

  <p>
    And don't worry if something breaks — this is a simulation. You can always
    reload your environment and start fresh.
