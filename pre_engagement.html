  1. Pre-Engagement
</p>

<h3>Hack the System, Not the Law</h3>
<h1>Always Get Permission First</h1>
<br />
<p>
  Before testing any system, it's
  <b>crucial to have a clear agreement</b>
  with the client about what will be tested, how, and why. This prevents
  misunderstandings and ensures that the test's scope, timeline, communication
  methods, and legal boundaries are clearly defined from the start. If the
  system being tested belongs to a third party, you'll also need written
  permission from them before proceeding.
</p>
<p>
  Getting written permission isn't just a formality — it's a must. The client
  needs to fully understand that testing may reveal sensitive information and
  explicitly authorize access to it. It's also vital to set boundaries: for
  example, taking unauthorized steps beyond the defined scope or accessing
  third-party systems is not allowed — even if a vulnerability makes it
  technically possible.
</p>
<p>
  A good contract protects both sides. It ensures ethical conduct, legal
  clarity, and mutual trust. That's why before any testing begins, everything is
  laid out in a formal agreement — and signed by both parties.

  <h2>Penetration Testing Agreement</h2>
  <div class="contract-content">
    <b>PARTIES</b>
    <p>Client: Da Vivian Code, represented by Vivian C.</p>
    <p>Penetration Tester: You, the best white-hat hacker in the making.</p>
    <b>OBJECTIVE</b>
    <p>
      The purpose of this agreement is to authorize the Tester to conduct a
      penetration test on the Da Vivian Code infrastructure to identify security
      vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious attackers. The goal
      is to improve the overall security of the system.
    </p>
    <b>SCOPE</b>
    <p>
      The following assets and systems are within the scope of this penetration
      test:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Da Vivian Code web server and associated web site.</li>
      <li>
        User accounts, configurations, and potential access control flaws.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identification and controlled exploitation of security weaknesses.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Out of scope:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any infrastructure, devices, or networks outside Da Vivian Code.</li>
      <li>
        Attacks that may result in data loss, permanent system modifications, or
        downtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creation of persistent access methods (e.g. installing backdoors,
        reverse shells, or hidden users).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>RULES</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Testing must be conducted ethically and with minimal disruption to the
        system.
      </li>
      <li>No malware, ransomware, or intentionally destructive actions.</li>
      <li>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are strictly prohibited.</li>
      <li>
        Access is limited to vulnerabilities discovered within the defined
        scope.
      </li>
      <li>No data may be deleted during testing.</li>
      <li>No permanent modifications may be made to the system.</li>
      <li>
        All findings must be reported promptly and confidentially to the client.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>RESPONSIBILITIES</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The customer is aware that sensitive information may be found during
        testing.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Tester agrees to maintain confidentiality regarding any
        vulnerabilities found.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Tester will document all findings in a detailed penetration testing
        report upon completion of the test.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>LIABILITY</b>
    <p>
      The Tester cannot be held responsible for any unexpected disruptions to
      the system as long as they follow the agreed-upon rules. The Client
      understands that penetration testing always involves some risks and agrees
      not to take legal action against the Tester for any activities that have
      been authorized in this agreement.
    </p>
    <b>DURATION</b>
    <p>
      This agreement is valid from the moment of acceptance and remains in
      effect until the final penetration test report is submitted.
