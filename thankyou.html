  <h1>&#x1F389;Thank You for Playing!&#x1F389;</h1>
  <h2>
    You've completed the Tracing Vulnerabilities penetration testing
    simulation&#x1F9EA;&#x1F4BB;
  </h2>
  <hr />
  <p style="max-width: 700px">
    Whether this was your first hands-on hacking experience or you're already
    walking the white-hat path —
    <b>you just followed a complete PTES-style process</b>: from defining the
    scope to presenting your findings. Not bad, right?
  </p>

  <p style="max-width: 700px">
    The skills you've practiced are the same techniques used by professional
    penetration testers &#x1F9E0; (and, yes, real-world attackers &#x1F480;).
    You've learned how systems are broken — and what makes them vulnerable.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h3>&#x1F680; What's Next?</h3>
  <p style="max-width: 700px">
    That's totally up to you. You now have a solid foundation and a growing set
    of tools. If this lit a spark, keep going. Whether your next step is trying
    a new lab, repeating a scan or learning a single new command, it all counts
    as progress.
  </p>
  <p style="max-width: 700px">
    And it's okay if not everything clicked the first time. Revisit, retry, and
    rebuild — that's how real learning happens. Every challenge you tackle from
    now on will build on what you've already done here. So stay curious, stay
    persistent, and most importantly: stay ethical. There's a digital world out
    there that needs defenders like you. &#x1F4AA;
